# plant-leaf-disease-detection
The main aim of this project is to train the machine to predict the disease. Plant leaf disease will be basically identified by observing different patterns on the parts of the plant leaf. The disease part is detected through Image processing and Machine learning. The main algorithm used is K-means clustering. The datasets were picked up from Kaggle.
